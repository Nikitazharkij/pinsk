This is an adaptive design that adapts to different screen sizes. when the system detects the browser size, it selects the layout most appropriate for the screen.

The libraries are used in the design:
- responsImg.js (makes images load the smallest possible version of itself required for the current viewport size);
- viewportchecker.js (detects if an element is in the viewport);
- parallax.js (a parallax scrolling effect);
- swiper.js (a touch slider).
